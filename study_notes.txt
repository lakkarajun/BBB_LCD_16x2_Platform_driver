Q1: In lcd_exit( ) function, is class_destroy call first or platform_driver_unregister( )?
Ans: You must call platform_driver_unregister() first, and class_destroy() second.
i.e.
static void __exit lcd_exit(void)
{
    platform_driver_unregister(&lcd_driver);  // 1. unregister driver
    class_destroy(lcd_class);                 // 2. destroy class
}

Why this order?
1. platform_driver_unregister() must run first
  When you unregister the platform driver:
  - The kernel calls your driver's remove() callback
  - Your remove() function will normally call device_destroy() / device_unregister()
  Those devices belong to the class
So the class must still exist while devices are being removed.

Wrong order?
Then:
class_destroy() removes /sys/class/bone_lcd/
After this, driver unregistration triggers your .remove()
.remove() will try:
  device_unregister(dev);
But the class no longer exists → kernel warnings, crashes, or sysfs corruption
Wrong order causes:
-------------------
sysfs: cannot find kobject...
WARNING: memory leak in kobject
Device nodes not cleaned up
Kernel oops if device_destroy() references a destroyed class

Q2: After allocate driver data structure memory, do i need to call platform_set_drvdata() ?

Ans: Yes — you should call platform_set_drvdata() after allocating your driver private data structure.
Why you should call platform_set_drvdata()?
- you now have a per-device driver private data struct.
- This structure needs to be retrievable later from:
  * remove()
  * sysfs attribute callbacks (show() / store())
  * interrupt handlers
  * workqueues
  * any helper function that gets only struct device *dev
Linux provides a built-in storage pointer inside struct device for exactly this purpose.
* you can retrieve it: struct driver_private_data *drv_data = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
* inside remove(): struct driver_private_data *drv_data = platform_get_drvdata(pdev);

Q3. After adding the LCD class attributes, the build was successful. Able to load LCD 
module and class attributes appear in "bone_lcd" class. Able to read "RW" attribute by
using the cat command. But when writing the value to the "WO" command, the attribute store
function is called repeatedly. why?

Ans: In sysfs, if the returned value is not equal to the input buffer length, the kernel
 retries the write—leading to the store handler being called again and again.
Root Cause:
-----------
store() return value mismatch:
Your store() must return count (number of bytes written).
If you return 0, -EINVAL, -EIO, or anything other than count, sysfs will call store() again.
Second common cause:
--------------------
attribute defined as RW instead of WO:
If you used: DEVICE_ATTR(wo, 0666, wo_show, wo_store); or
DEVICE_ATTR_RW(wo);
But your wo_show() returns garbage or errors, the kernel may try to "fix" it by retrying write.For a write-only attribute, you should use: DEVICE_ATTR_WO(wo);
or manually: static DEVICE_ATTR(wo, 0220, NULL, wo_store);
Permissions must be:
0220 → write-only
No .show() function
Third cause:
------------
cat/echo behavior:
Remember:
echo 1 > /sys/class/bone_lcd/lcd0/wo
shell writes '1\n' (two bytes!)
Your store() receives buffer "1\n", count = 2
You must return 2, not 1.
Otherwise sysfs retries.

Q4: In platform device driver development, I have device private data structure and driver
private data structure. If i want to track general device structure 
(i.e "struct device *dev"), where to define?

Ans: You should store struct device *dev inside the driver private data structure
(the structure you manage inside .probe() and attach with dev_set_drvdata()).
Why?
"struct device *dev" belongs to the device core — not to the device tree data or
your custom platform_data.
Your platform driver is responsible for handling the Linux device model,
so the driver’s private data is the proper place to keep a pointer to dev.

Platform data (your device private data) should only contain the hardware-specific
static configuration (like GPIO numbers, register offsets, device capabilities),
and not runtime kernel objects like struct device.
How to access later in any function:
-  struct driver_private_data *drv_data = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
Where NOT to store struct device *dev
-------------------------------------
- Avoid storing in:
  * Device private data struct - DT or board info must stay pure and reusable 
    — no kernel objects
  * Global variables - Prevents multiple devices / multi-instance support
  * Platform device struct modifications - Not recommended; platform device is owned
    by core layer

Q5: What are the argument pass to device_create_with_groups( ) function?

Ans: 
Here is the function signature:
struct device *device_create_with_groups(struct class *cls,
                                         struct device *parent,
                                         dev_t devt,
                                         void *drvdata,
                                         const struct attribute_group **groups,
                                         const char *fmt, ...);
1. cls: Your class object (created using class_create()), pass as first parameter.
2. parent: Usually NULL unless your device has a parent.
   For platform drivers, you normally pass: parent = NULL;
   (Unless you want the created device to appear under another device.)
3. devt: Device number—not needed unless you expose a character device.
   If you do not use a char device, set: devt = 0;
   If you do use a char device, pass your allocated dev_t: devt = MKDEV(major, minor);
4. drvdata: Pointer to your driver private data, stored in the struct device so you can
   retrieve it later via dev_get_drvdata().
5. groups: Array of pointers to struct attribute_group.
   Important: Must be a NULL-terminated list.
6. fmt / ...: The format string for the device name (same as device_create()):
   "fmt" = "lcd%d", id
   This will create: /sys/class/bone_lcd/lcd0

Q6: where to call "class_create()"? I mean call in init() or probe() function?

Ans: Call class_create() in your module’s init function — NOT inside the probe().
     This is the correct and recommended pattern.
Why class_create() must be called in module_init():
---------------------------------------------------
A class represents a global sysfs class (like i2c, spi, tty, block, your "bone_lcd", etc.).
It is not device-specific and not tied to a particular platform device instance.
Therefore:
 - A class should be created once when the module loads.
 - The class should work for all future devices that your driver supports.
 - The class must be destroyed when the module unloads.
So, it cannot live inside .probe(), because .probe() may run multiple times—one per device
instance.
